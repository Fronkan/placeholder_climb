The game was created as a part of the game jam: https://itch.io/jam/kodsnacks-2veckorssylt.
Around the theme of mustasch and platformer. It is created using the game engine: löve/love2d



## The Game
You are a placeholder block on the run from the pesky developers trying to delete you. The clever disguise have failed and your only option is to get higher up in the stack.

The game is a endless climber. Get as high as possible to get that sweet sweet highscore!
